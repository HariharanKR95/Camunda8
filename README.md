<h1 align="left">What is business process management (BPM)?</h1>

Business process management (BPM) is the practice of modeling, analyzing, and optimizing end-to-end business processes to help meet your strategic business goals, such as the improvement of your customer experience framework. BPM methodology can be applied to tasks and processes that are often repeated, ongoing, or predictable.

A business process is a set of activities that help a business reach a specific goal. Using BPM, you can evaluate your existing processes to find ways to improve efficiency, reduce costs and errors, and support digital transformation efforts.

<h1 align="left">what is BPMN:</h1>

Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), also called Business Process Model and Notation, is an open standard to diagram a business process. It is like a flowchart and uses standardized graphics to represent the participants, choices and flow of the process.

<h1 align="left">What is Camunda:</h1>
Camunda is an open-source platform that uses a workflow engine and decision engine to automate business processes. Organizations can use it to automate workflow and decision processes, freeing up time for employees to focus on more thoughtful projects.

<h1 align="left">How many ways to distribute camunda setup:</h1>
Camunda shared process engine distribution with Embeded tomcate
Using spring boot

<h1 align="left">Differences between camunda 7 and Camunda 8:</h1>
Camunda 7 based on activity engin & Camunda 8 based on zeebe engin which is self developed and zeebe scalable horizontally and linearly because of elastic search based back-end intead of dbms

Camunda 7 has shared engin, embeded engin, remote engine where as Camunda 8 has only remote engine.

Task processing in camunda 8 is asynchronous whereas in camunda 7 it can be synchronus.

Camunda 7 uses REST API to talk to the engine whereas in camunda 8 uses GRPC protocol based getway to talk to the engine.

camunda 7 engine wokrs on pushing whereas camunda 8 engine wokrs on polling.

camunda 7 does not offering software as a service (SAAS), where as camunda 8 offering SAAS.

<h1 align="left">Zeebe :</h1>
Zeebe is the process automation engine powering Camunda Platform 8.

<h1 align="left">With Zeebe you can:</h1>
Define processes graphically in BPMN 2.0.
Choose any gRPC-supported programming language to implement your workers.
Use as part of a software as a service (SaaS) offering with Camunda Platform 8 or deploy with Docker and Kubernetes (in the cloud or on-premises) with Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed.
Scale horizontally to handle very high throughput.
Export processes data for monitoring and analysis (currently only available through the Elasticsearch exporter added in Camunda Platform 8 Self-Managed).
There are four main components in Zeebe's architecture: clients, gateways, brokers, and exporters.
